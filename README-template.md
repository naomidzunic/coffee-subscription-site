## My process

When I realized I finished a simple HTML & CSS project within 24 hours I knew that I was ready to challenge myself with more Javascript & React. I chose this project because I felt it had enough JS where it didn't seem too hard but didn't seem impossible. Sure I'll be Googling more and asking for help more often but that's a part of the process. I also chose to go with React JS as a way to get comfortable with creating apps with it as future jobs will likely require it. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This was definitely way out of my comfort zone. But there were many things that I learned:

## Journalling (optional)

Day 4?
So it's been a few days since I started out this project and I wanted to log my thoughts here (maybe this will become a blog some day). But I will say the hardest things so far have been setting up React and ensuring the components are all connected and working properly as well as making sure I'm using JSX and Javascript correctly in there. I had been using Scrimba for taking courses and what's nice about Scrimba is that they really interactive site that allows you to practice coding in real time with the lessons. But when I opened React App for the first time I definitely was a little overwhelmed with the amount of files there were. Turns out a lot of them you could just delete them.

I've been working on a decent pace, allowing myself breaks and also times for problem solving and othertimes to just not think much. Today a lot was spent on figuring out how to make the nav menu responsive when clicked on mobile. And trying to find something like that online is hard when people use different packages and methods. Nevertheless, I stopped and reached out to Stack Overflow and Reddit (which have been helpful -- although sometimes I figure out my own by the time someone has answered) and then during the time I allow people to respond I'll style the components as needed, which is helping solidify my HTML & CSS skills tremendously. 

At the end of the day it took me the longest to get a 4 columns down for desktop to 1 column with horizontal text for tablet and 1 column vertical text for mobile. At first I thought grid was the best way but in the end it didn't work out the way I wanted it to especially since the tablet was the only one that had horizontal text. So I stuck to flexbox. I'm not quite done yet but tomorrow I plan on finalizing that in the morning and then continue on with the navigation menu.
